Ranger Aerospace has transacted over $360 Million in its numerous buy/sell events and capital investments across multiple platforms, creating over 2500 new permanent jobs in its successful ventures. ASIG and Keystone Helicopter, both of which were grown dramatically by Ranger, were later divested to multi-billion sized conglomerates.Join us at our May Learning Lunch as we learn how Ranger Aerospace has developed a strategy for aquiring and building aviation businesses from their Greenville offices.

Plan to attend.\r\nLunch is $25 at the door.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout our Speaker:\r\nSteve Townes is President, CEO and a Director of Ranger Aerospace, the company that he founded in early 1997. He has held several CEO positions in Ranger\u2019s ventures, notably of Keystone Helicopter, ASIG, and most currently Ranger International Services Group, Inc. Townes and the Ranger team grew Keystone Helicopter from under $50MM to over $125MM in 4 years, creating superior returns for institutional investors. He and the Ranger team roughly doubled ASIG in less than 4 years, and vaulted it to \u201cbest in world\u201d quality rankings. In 2007, Ranger Rotorcraft Group was formed as another new platform company for additional segment consolidation efforts, in partnership with private equity institutional investors. In December 2008, Ranger International Services Group was capitalized with private and institutional funds to create a consolidation in government-outsourced Airfield Services & Logistics, with Townes as CEO. Ranger International made its first acquisition in January 2009, and is pursuing organic growth plus additional acquisitions in that sector.\r\n\r\nTownes is an engineering graduate of West Point. Steve earned the coveted Eisenhower Award upon graduation there. He also holds an MBA from Long Island University and completed the PMD program at Harvard Business School. He is a featured speaker at aerospace conventions and symposia and has testified on aviation matters before the U.S. House of Representatives, FAA and NTSB.\r\n\r\nUnder his leadership for over 10 years, Ranger\u2019s previous subsidiary revenues and profits rose steadily. In April 1999, ASIG was voted \"Best in World\" in an independent survey of major airlines, and Ranger was cited as an innovative new parent company. Keystone Helicopter won numerous FAA \u201cDiamond Awards\u201d for quality. Enterprise Value in Ranger\u2019s most recently sold venture more than quadrupled under Townes\u2019 leadership. Efforts are intended to follow the same success patterns with Ranger\u2019s newest enterprises.\r\n\r\nTownes\u2019 diverse background spans three decades in the commercial, corporate, and military aviation industry. Before going independent with Ranger Aerospace in 1997, he was previously Vice Chairman, and earlier President, of Sabreliner Corporation's heavy aircraft services divisions. Under Townes, that business was doubled in size, underwent a successful turnaround, struggled through an emergency crisis following a tragic crash, revamped its training and quality programs, and won new backlogs worth more than $500 million in multi-year revenues.\r\n\r\nTownes, known as a turnaround specialist, general manager, marketing expert, change agent and dealmaker in the industry, gained positive recognition by the trade press as an industry leader from Congressional, FAA and NTSB appearances in past years, calling for industry safety reforms, better auditing, and cargo hold smoke detectors. He was President and Partner of an avionics components house that doubled in size under Townes' marketing leadership. Townes was Executive Vice President of Stevens Aviation, a $115 million multi-city aviation services chain which more than doubled in size and made two acquisitions while Townes was its chief operations, marketing and technical services officer.\r\n\r\nTownes has also been Vice President of Major Programs and Marketing of the Dee Howard Aerospace Corporation, as well as a Program Leader and Marketing Leader in LTV Aerospace and Defense. His diverse and distinguished aerospace career has made him an ideal partner with private equity groups, venture capitalists, and other co-investors in Ranger Aerospace acquisitions.\r\n\r\nHis CEO level skills are also well suited to the consulting, Board level coaching, capital raising, and deal-making efforts of Ranger Partners Group on behalf of its client companies. For example, Townes is on the Board of a middle market sized aerospace and avionics components company in Atlanta that has grown from under $15MM to over $50MM in less than 4 years, and Steve acts as an effective Board coach for the young entrepreneurs who run that fast growing enterprise.\r\n\r\n\r\n", "data_as_of": "2017-11-04T18:11:23Z"}, {"event_name": "Learning Lunch: InnoMobility and Beyond - A Platform to Grow and Connect Future Technologies", "group_name": "GSATC", "venue": {"address": {"address_1": "670 Verdae Blvd", "address_2": null, "city": "Greenville", "region": null, "postal_code": "29607", "country": "US", "latitude": "34.8263361", "longitude": "-82.3259364", "localized_address_display": "670 Verdae Blvd, Greenville, 29607", "localized_area_display": "Greenville", "localized_multi_line_address_display": ["670 Verdae Blvd", "Greenville, 29607"]}, "resource_uri": "https://www.eventbriteapi.com/v3/venues/152367/", "id": "152367", "name": null, "latitude": "34.8263361", "longitude": "-82.3259364"}, "url": "https://www.eventbrite.com/e/learning-lunch-innomobility-and-beyond-a-platform-to-grow-and-connect-future-technologies-tickets-1725522083", "time": "2011-06-08T15:30:00Z", "rsvp_count": null, "created_at": "2011-05-23T15:56:57Z", "description": "We just had a great GSATC lunch where Steve Townes explained to us how Ranger Aerospace has achieved phenomenal growth in aerospace.

proliferation of BI and analytical tools at a price-point that even small and medium sized companies can afford.\u00a0 At the heart of an efficient , responsive and flexible BI solution is a dimensional model.\u00a0\u00a0 Even if you just need to make your reporting system more efficient and do not have lofty goals of Business Scorecarding with Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) or creating forecasting models with data mining algorithms, knowing how and when to create a dimensional model is a must have skill in the 21st century.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\nThis will be a

2005 Report Builder is a useful but often over-looked tool in the SQL Server 2005 platform.\u00a0 A new addition with 2005 Reporting Services, Report Builder enables end-users to create and publish their own ad-hoc reports without the need to know SQL or understand the backend data model.\u00a0 As a .NET Winforms \u201cClickonce\u201d application, Report Builder can easily be deployed to your users with a simple click from within Reporting Services.\u00a0 However, it\u2019s not all paradise.\u00a0 There are some interesting quirks and limitations to this 1.0 product that can challenge even the best SQL Server guru.\u00a0 We\u2019ll discuss the history, uses, best practices, and tips to the latest addition to the Microsoft SQL Server family.\r\n\u00a0\r\nAbout Jason:\u00a0 Jason is currently a Business Intelligence Architect at Ameco, a subsidiary of Fluor.\u00a0 He has been working in IT for over 11 years developing both internal and external web, e-commerce, and data warehouse applications.\u00a0 He\u2019s a \u201csql ninja\u201d that has been hacking out T-SQL since SQL Server 6.0.\u00a0 He has presented at the SC Code Camp and the SQL Server Innovators Guild. \r\n\r\n",

Starting\u00a0with the basics of how to relate security to\u00a0business personnel, we'll then dive in to the technical aspects of locking down SQL Server. SQL Server 2000 through 2008 will be covered.\u00a0\r\nK. Brian Kelly is a SQL Server author and columnist focusing primarily on SQL Server security. He is a contributing author for How to Cheat at Securing SQL Server 2005 (Syngress) and Professional SQL Server 2008 Administration (Wrox). Brian currently serves as a\u00a0database administrator /\u00a0architect for AgFirst Farm Credit Bank. He formerly served as a systems and security architect\u00a0where he worked on Active Directory, Windows security, VMware, Citrix, and of course, SQL Server.

However, for simple, straightforward data transfer tasks, creating SSIS packages by hand can be time-consuming and repetitious. By attending this session, you'll learn how to automate data transfers from a source to a target using SSIS. You\u2019ll see the steps necessary to create both the control flow and the data flow portions of an SSIS package using the API and C# code. You\u2019ll also learn about altering existing packages programmatically. Specific attention will be given to the generation of data flows with the proper source and destination components. We\u2019ll take a look at some of the open source solutions available for this, plus some \u201croll your own\u201d options.\r\n\u00a0\r\nTakeaways:1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Generating Control Flow Tasks through the API2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Generating Data Flow Components through the API3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 How to Alter Existing Packages Programmatically\r\n\u00a0\r\nJohn Welch is Chief Architect with Mariner, a consulting firm specializing in enterprise reporting & analytics, data warehousing and performance management solutions.

A barrier to realizing that potential is that we don\u2019t always understand or trust the techniques that reveal these insights.\r\n\r\nThe payoffs from data analysis can be tremendous, but to realize them we have to know how to match the analytical techniques with our business questions/purposes, and with the data. The session will illustrate this simple idea with three examples of techniques borrowed from artificial intelligence: Genetic Algorithms for optimization, Artificial Neural Networks for prediction, and the ID3 algorithm for classification. Specific attention will be paid to:\r\n\r\n\r\nHow they work\r\nWhat you can do with them\r\nWhen to use them with or instead of statistical techniques\r\nHow to evaluate the results\r\n\r\n\r\nThese techniques are valuable because they are heuristic rather than statistical, are easily understood without advanced mathematics, are often simpler to use, and will deliver better answers than standard methods in a variety of situations.\r\n\u00a0\r\nAbout Jim Eynon\r\n\u00a0\r\nJim's first job from college was with a data service company where he hung a very large but uncounted number of round-reel tapes.

His research is published in information systems journals and conference proceedings. He consulting work includes problems in Manufacturing, banking and financial services, health care, government agencies, transportation, education, and \u00a0retail. \u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\nSponsor\r\n\r\nVarigence provides tools, frameworks, and services that advance the state of the art in business intelligence by building abstraction and productivity capabilities to extend the Microsoft Business Intelligence technologies.\r\n\u00a0\r\n", "data_as_of": "2017-11-04T18:11:23Z"}, {"event_name": "Agile Database Administration", "group_name": "SQL Server Innovators Guild", "venue": {"address": {"address_1": "1001 Keys Dr", "address_2": null, "city": "Greenville", "region": "SC", "postal_code": "29615", "country": "US", "latitude": "34.84496", "longitude": "-82.313811", "localized_address_display": "1001 Keys Dr, Greenville, SC 29615", "localized_area_display": "Greenville, SC", "localized_multi_line_address_display": ["1001 Keys Dr", "Greenville, SC 29615"]}, "resource_uri": "https://www.eventbriteapi.com/v3/venues/23475/", "id": "23475", "name": "ECPI, Greenville, SC", "latitude": "34.84496", "longitude": "-82.313811"}, "url": "https://www.eventbrite.com/e/agile-database-administration-tickets-3052194195", "time": "2012-03-06T23:00:00Z", "rsvp_count": null, "created_at": "2012-02-29T02:59:44Z", "description": "\u00a0\r\n6:00 \u2013 6:30 Food and Networking Sponsored by FGP\r\n6:30 \u2013 6:45 Announcements\r\n6:45 \u2013 8:15\u00a0Stuart R Ainsworth:\u00a0Agile Database Administration\r\n8:15 \u2013 8:30 Closing remarks and give-a-ways. \u00a0\r\nAgile Database Administration\u00a0\r\nAgile development is all the rage, but how do the principles apply to database administrators? \u00a0This presentation will introduce the basics of the Agile Manifesto, and explain how they can be applied to non-development IT work, such as database administration, maintenance, and support. \u00a0We'll cover scrum (one of the most popular development methodologies) and kanban, and identify some of the common struggles with implementing them in an organization. \u00a0This is an interactive discussion; please bring your tales of success and your horror stories.\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\nStuart R.

We meet from 5:30 to 7:30 and we're on a mission to help people make the connections they need to advance their businesses and careers.\r\nWhat\u2019s Happening\r\nRSVP Online and bring a business card with you and the first beer is on us.

Your old phones will be recycled or refurbished and given to victims of domestic violence so they have a critical communication tool to feel safer and less isolated when they attempt to remove themselves from a violent situation.\r\nFor more information about HopeLine, visit\u00a0www.verizonwireless.com/hopeline.\r\n\u00a0\r\nWith support from:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat are people saying about Tech After Five?\r\n\r\nGreat opportunity to meet people and share ideas.

It might imply opening up to new ideas or experiences\u2026 letting go of your masks or limiting emotions\u2026 revealing an epiphany that was previously hidden\u2026 shedding stereotypes and fears which confine\u2026 or peeling back layers so the heart of a problem emerges.When we\u2019re \u201cunzipped,\u201d intrinsic creative qualities such as wonder, enchantment, exploration, play, and delight emerge naturally. We readily pursue passions. And differences in attitudes, appearance, and lifestyle matter less\u2026 or not at all. Existing and thinking differently becomes natural and accepted.Our 2014 theme may seem like an odd choice to some, but, in the spirit of TED, it\u2019s a positive challenge to our comfort zones and levels of acceptance.
