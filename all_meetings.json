On Thursday, February 7 we'll be kicking off with our 1st Meetup of the year. We will be talking about Automation with Ansible! Why Ansible? Why Automation? Because if you are not automating your infrastructure, your deploys, your processes then you're falling behind. Automation reduces human error, speeds up deployments, and is just plain awesome to do! If you want to get a jump on things and dig into some Ansible before the meetup then check out - <a href=\"https://www.ansible.com/overview/it-automation\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.ansible.com/overview/it-automation</a> or the Git Hub project - <a href=\"https://github.com/ansible/ansible\" class=\"linkified\">https://github.com/ansible/ansible</a> So whether you're an Ansible newbie or seasoned pro then join us! Would love to have you come and talk about your experiences with Automation. Lunch is provided and the meeting is free to attend. All we ask is that you register here so we can get a better count of how much food to have prepared. Here is the agenda for the meeting: 11:30 - 12:00 - Lunch, networking<br/>12:00 - 12:45 - Automation with Ansible!<br/>12:45 - 1:00 - Q/A and dismissal So bring your questions, your ideas, and be prepared to learn something new! If you have any questions, comments, or concerns please ping me on Meetup or start a discussion! ~Allen ps.

Usability matters.\" \r\n\r\nSoftware is delivered every day that seems to have completely ignored the topic of usability.\u00a0 But usability matters, whether it's software, engineering, a button on a screen, a too complicated swipe on the screen of an iPad or a gas pedal that's just a bit too close to the brake pedal in a car.\u00a0 Failures can be frustrating or devastating, but they can be avoided by applying some basic principles and tests.\u00a0 Join us in January as we hear from Juan Gilbert, the chair of the Human Centered Computing Division at Clemson University.\r\nHow do you know if your interface or system is usable? In engineering, there are metrics for measuring efficiency and other thresholds of products, but in computing, we don't have similar metrics that are \"standard\". Dr. Gilbert has developed the Holistic Usability Measure (HUM) to address this very issue.

Plan to attend.\r\nLunch is $25 at the door.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout our Speaker:\r\nSteve Townes is President, CEO and a Director of Ranger Aerospace, the company that he founded in early 1997. He has held several CEO positions in Ranger\u2019s ventures, notably of Keystone Helicopter, ASIG, and most currently Ranger International Services Group, Inc. Townes and the Ranger team grew Keystone Helicopter from under $50MM to over $125MM in 4 years, creating superior returns for institutional investors. He and the Ranger team roughly doubled ASIG in less than 4 years, and vaulted it to \u201cbest in world\u201d quality rankings. In 2007, Ranger Rotorcraft Group was formed as another new platform company for additional segment consolidation efforts, in partnership with private equity institutional investors. In December 2008, Ranger International Services Group was capitalized with private and institutional funds to create a consolidation in government-outsourced Airfield Services & Logistics, with Townes as CEO. Ranger International made its first acquisition in January 2009, and is pursuing organic growth plus additional acquisitions in that sector.\r\n\r\nTownes is an engineering graduate of West Point. Steve earned the coveted Eisenhower Award upon graduation there. He also holds an MBA from Long Island University and completed the PMD program at Harvard Business School. He is a featured speaker at aerospace conventions and symposia and has testified on aviation matters before the U.S. House of Representatives, FAA and NTSB.\r\n\r\nUnder his leadership for over 10 years, Ranger\u2019s previous subsidiary revenues and profits rose steadily. In April 1999, ASIG was voted \"Best in World\" in an independent survey of major airlines, and Ranger was cited as an innovative new parent company. Keystone Helicopter won numerous FAA \u201cDiamond Awards\u201d for quality. Enterprise Value in Ranger\u2019s most recently sold venture more than quadrupled under Townes\u2019 leadership. Efforts are intended to follow the same success patterns with Ranger\u2019s newest enterprises.\r\n\r\nTownes\u2019 diverse background spans three decades in the commercial, corporate, and military aviation industry. Before going independent with Ranger Aerospace in 1997, he was previously Vice Chairman, and earlier President, of Sabreliner Corporation's heavy aircraft services divisions. Under Townes, that business was doubled in size, underwent a successful turnaround, struggled through an emergency crisis following a tragic crash, revamped its training and quality programs, and won new backlogs worth more than $500 million in multi-year revenues.\r\n\r\nTownes, known as a turnaround specialist, general manager, marketing expert, change agent and dealmaker in the industry, gained positive recognition by the trade press as an industry leader from Congressional, FAA and NTSB appearances in past years, calling for industry safety reforms, better auditing, and cargo hold smoke detectors. He was President and Partner of an avionics components house that doubled in size under Townes' marketing leadership. Townes was Executive Vice President of Stevens Aviation, a $115 million multi-city aviation services chain which more than doubled in size and made two acquisitions while Townes was its chief operations, marketing and technical services officer.\r\n\r\nTownes has also been Vice President of Major Programs and Marketing of the Dee Howard Aerospace Corporation, as well as a Program Leader and Marketing Leader in LTV Aerospace and Defense. His diverse and distinguished aerospace career has made him an ideal partner with private equity groups, venture capitalists, and other co-investors in Ranger Aerospace acquisitions.\r\n\r\nHis CEO level skills are also well suited to the consulting, Board level coaching, capital raising, and deal-making efforts of Ranger Partners Group on behalf of its client companies. For example, Townes is on the Board of a middle market sized aerospace and avionics components company in Atlanta that has grown from under $15MM to over $50MM in less than 4 years, and Steve acts as an effective Board coach for the young entrepreneurs who run that fast growing enterprise.\r\n\r\n\r\n", "uuid": "d0baef4f-4771-40b5-8e08-8a8e30095d85", "nid": "19", "data_as_of": "2019-01-27T05:43:14Z"}, {"event_name": "Learning Lunch: InnoMobility and Beyond - A Platform to Grow and Connect Future Technologies", "group_name": "GSATC", "venue": {"name": null, "address": "670 Verdae Blvd, None", "city": "Greenville", "state": null, "zip": "29607", "country": "US", "lat": "34.8263361", "lon": "-82.3259364"}, "url": "https://www.eventbrite.com/e/learning-lunch-innomobility-and-beyond-a-platform-to-grow-and-connect-future-technologies-tickets-1725522083", "time": "2011-06-08T15:30:00Z", "tags": "", "rsvp_count": null, "created_at": "2011-05-23T15:56:57Z", "description": "We just had a great GSATC lunch where Steve Townes explained to us how Ranger Aerospace has achieved phenomenal growth in aerospace.

I count myself lucky because I am surrounded by creative, intelligent and successful people. To be more direct, I have a real cadre of friends I would like to be more like. I have had many of them tell me about the breakthrough moments and real encouragement they have received by participating in mastermind groups. If you're like me, you may not be exactly sure what a mastermind group is. At first, I thought it might have something to do with that guy from the Austin Powers movie, but it turns out I was wrong. Mastermind groups are people who come together with a common interest in a facilitated, focused discussion designed to help people succeed by overcoming whatever is currently in their way. Smart people tell me this works. I'm going to give it a try. I'm inviting a limited number of our compatriots, which means you, to join me in this experiment. Allow me to explain.To help me make this work, I've invited a new friend of mine, Dean Storer to help facilitate. He is the author of \"The Make it Happen Man\" and is an experienced mastermind group facilitator. While he always starts the groups out thinking they will run ten weeks, he has had groups that are so valuable to the participants that they are meeting two years later. Wow! They must be getting something out of it to keep meeting like that. I'm excited by the prospect.We are going to offer a mastermind group for ten weeks on Monday mornings in the GSATC offices. If you participate you will get the book we will be reading, an extensive workbook that will guide our discussions, and a chance to hang out with Dean Storer, Phil Yanov, and a group of other people who are committed to taking action toward their own success. Does that sound interesting?You might need to know more.\u00a0 If so, let me have Dean explain...\r\nHere\u2019s How 1 + 1 Equals 11!\r\nby Dean Storer\r\nDo the Math: If you are a business owner and you want to increase your revenue and find innovative ideas for your business, you need a mastermind!The What and Why of MastermindingYou\u2019ve all heard about it and seen the results successful business owners are achieving, but do you really know what a Mastermind is? In short, a mastermind is two or more people who come together to share their ideas, skills and knowledge to increase business revenue, create innovative solutions for complex business challenges, and form an alliance of minds to be the best they can be!Why Masterminding is Essential for Business and Personal GrowthMasterminding is not a new idea, or the most recent business growth quick fix! Masterminding was first introduced by Napoleon Hill, author of Think and Grow Rich, who said \u201cNo two minds ever come together without thereby creating a third, invisible intangible force, which may be likened to a third mind.\u201d The most successful business owners, either now or in the past, have been involved in a mastermind group. Think Henry Ford, Thomas Edison, and even Disney, all of whom have belonged to a mastermind group and have achieved enormous success!How a Mastermind can significantly improve your businessIt can be lonely at the top, and recent studies have shown that our brains work better when collaborating in groups versus relying solely on ourselves. Working in a group allows for the \u201cthird mind,\u201d this greater intelligence, to expand what is possible. Wouldn\u2019t it be great to have a group of people with opposing strengths that complement one another? One of the key benefits in forming a mastermind group is having a support system in place with people who have a diverse skill set, unique experiences, and a desire to be the best. Also, a mastermind group provides a medium for you to share your unique skills and knowledge to reinforce what you know. Furthermore, you have instant accountability, and we all know that we are 90% more likely to achieve our goals when we have to answer to someone else! Making instant contacts and connections with other business owners is one of the many bonuses of a mastermind group.If this sounds like you, we'd like to have you. Seating is strictly limited.\r\n\u00a0\r\nMonday Mastermind Sessions\r\nThe Details:\r\nWe will meet every Monday for ten weeks beginning March 5, 2012.

However, for simple, straightforward data transfer tasks, creating SSIS packages by hand can be time-consuming and repetitious. By attending this session, you'll learn how to automate data transfers from a source to a target using SSIS. You\u2019ll see the steps necessary to create both the control flow and the data flow portions of an SSIS package using the API and C# code. You\u2019ll also learn about altering existing packages programmatically. Specific attention will be given to the generation of data flows with the proper source and destination components. We\u2019ll take a look at some of the open source solutions available for this, plus some \u201croll your own\u201d options.\r\n\u00a0\r\nTakeaways:1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Generating Control Flow Tasks through the API2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Generating Data Flow Components through the API3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 How to Alter Existing Packages Programmatically\r\n\u00a0\r\nJohn Welch is Chief Architect with Mariner, a consulting firm specializing in enterprise reporting & analytics, data warehousing and performance management solutions.

A barrier to realizing that potential is that we don\u2019t always understand or trust the techniques that reveal these insights.\r\n\r\nThe payoffs from data analysis can be tremendous, but to realize them we have to know how to match the analytical techniques with our business questions/purposes, and with the data. The session will illustrate this simple idea with three examples of techniques borrowed from artificial intelligence: Genetic Algorithms for optimization, Artificial Neural Networks for prediction, and the ID3 algorithm for classification. Specific attention will be paid to:\r\n\r\n\r\nHow they work\r\nWhat you can do with them\r\nWhen to use them with or instead of statistical techniques\r\nHow to evaluate the results\r\n\r\n\r\nThese techniques are valuable because they are heuristic rather than statistical, are easily understood without advanced mathematics, are often simpler to use, and will deliver better answers than standard methods in a variety of situations.\r\n\u00a0\r\nAbout Jim Eynon\r\n\u00a0\r\nJim's first job from college was with a data service company where he hung a very large but uncounted number of round-reel tapes. He subsequently mastered other obsolete technologies such as writing COBOL and Mark IV. Eventually this all drove him to graduate school for a PhD in the Management of Information. \u00a0He has served on the faculty at Wake Forest and Northern Illinois Universities, teaching Systems Analysis and Design, Database Systems, Management Science and Information Systems Strategy. His research is published in information systems journals and conference proceedings.

Good examples are monthly, quarterly, and yearly for financial systems and the holiday season for retail. The last thing you want to have in these timeframes is your CxO standing at your desk wondering why things are slow or possibly down. Ensuring that your SQL Servers are optimally configured for those heavy usage periods cannot be done with a wing and a prayer \u2013 you need an actionable, realistic plan.

To make load time fast it is helpful to have values in the source system rows to indicate the order of row inserts and updates. It is also nice to have a way to tell when a row was deleted. Unfortunately, there are too many applications and databases that do not implement this basic best practice.

Many of us use T-SQL Merge to process SCDs because the pattern is well known and it performs reasonably well. However, many experts in the SQL Server Community recommend that we stop using it, due to many outstanding bugs, but have not recommended a suitable T-SQL alternative. \r\nIn this session, I'll show you how I use standard CRUD (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete), mostly Inserts and Updates, to process Slowly Changing Dimensions. My current design pattern yields high performance, great flexibility, and easily maintainable code.

At our TEDxGreenville event, TEDTalks video and live speakers will combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events, including ours, are self-organized.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n", "uuid": "7034cfee-a3bc-4456-b008-8c4db071d149", "nid": "45", "data_as_of": "2019-01-27T05:43:14Z"}, {"event_name": "TEDxGreenville Volunteer Breather", "group_name": "TEDx Greenville", "venue": {"name": "Russell Stall's Home", "address": "17 Riverside Drive, None", "city": "Greenville", "state": null, "zip": "29605", "country": "US", "lat": "34.812484", "lon": "-82.38127500000002"}, "url": "https://www.eventbrite.com/e/tedxgreenville-volunteer-breather-tickets-5492243448", "time": "2013-04-18T22:30:00Z", "tags": "", "rsvp_count": null, "created_at": "2013-04-05T14:08:31Z", "description": "Did you say party?\r\nOf course I did.

It\u2019s short\u2026 unexpected and memorable\u2026 and has broad, diverse meanings which makes it relevant to countless topics. It might imply opening up to new ideas or experiences\u2026 letting go of your masks or limiting emotions\u2026 revealing an epiphany that was previously hidden\u2026 shedding stereotypes and fears which confine\u2026 or peeling back layers so the heart of a problem emerges.When we\u2019re \u201cunzipped,\u201d intrinsic creative qualities such as wonder, enchantment, exploration, play, and delight emerge naturally. We readily pursue passions. And differences in attitudes, appearance, and lifestyle matter less\u2026 or not at all. Existing and thinking differently becomes natural and accepted.Our 2014 theme may seem like an odd choice to some, but, in the spirit of TED, it\u2019s a positive challenge to our comfort zones and levels of acceptance.

We hope you can join us for an evening of great conversation!\r\n\r\nKen Robinson: How schools kill creativityCreativity expert Sir Ken Robinson makes an entertaining and profoundly moving case for creating an education system that nurtures (rather than undermines) creativity. Creativity expert Sir Ken Robinson challenges the way we're educating our children. He champions a radical rethink of our school systems, to cultivate creativity and acknowledge multiple types of intelligence. This is the single most viewed talk on the TED.com website with over 27,792,177 views since its release in 2006.\r\nSalman Khan: Let's use video to reinvent educationIn 2004, Salman Khan, a hedge fund analyst, began posting math tutorials on YouTube. Six years later, he has posted more than 2,000 tutorials, which are viewed nearly 100,000 times around the world each day. Salman Khan talks about how and why he created the remarkable Khan Academy, a carefully structured series of educational videos offering complete curricula in math and, now, other subjects. He shows the power of interactive exercises, and calls for teachers to consider flipping the traditional classroom script \u2014 give students video lectures to watch at home, and do \"homework\" in the classroom with the teacher available to help.", "uuid": "7034cfee-a3bc-4456-b008-8c4db071d149", "nid": "45", "data_as_of": "2019-01-27T05:43:14Z"}, {"event_name": "TEDxGreenville Live from Rio", "group_name": "TEDx Greenville", "venue": {"name": "Coffee Underground", "address": "1 South Coffee Street, None", "city": "Greenville", "state": null, "zip": "29601", "country": "US", "lat": "34.8515676", "lon": "-82.39827159999999"}, "url": "https://www.eventbrite.com/e/tedxgreenville-live-from-rio-tickets-13453410513", "time": "2014-10-08T12:30:00Z", "tags": "", "rsvp_count": null, "created_at": "2014-10-02T03:56:43Z", "description": "\r\nTEDGlobal Being Livestreamed into Greenville\u00a0\r\nAfter seven years traveling the world, TEDGlobal is headed \"South!\" to Rio\r\nYou've heard about the TED conferences.

Both the lynching and the ensuing trial forced Greenville into the national spotlight. Walter Winchell, J. Edgar Hoover and even Strom Thurmond became involved. Our speaker, Lucy Beam Hoffman, co-authored the \u201cLast Lynching,\u201d a play centered around one of the most infamous and controversial chapters in Greenville\u2019s history.\r\nShe will be discussing how she came to write the play, the details of the Willie Earle lynching and the role racism plays \u2013 then and now \u2013 in our culture. Please join us for this talk followed by an interactive discussion.\r\nAdmission is free, but registration is required.\r\n\u00a0\r\nOur Speaker: Lucy Beam Hoffman has been an avid history lover and a voluminous writer all her life. But it wasn\u2019t until the age of 47 that she pursued a college degree in history. And it was only after she began teaching history on the college level \u2013 several years later -- that she began to seek out a way to blend her love for history with her love for writing. After a serendipitous encounter with writer John Jeter she co-authored \u201cThe Last Lynching,\u201d a play about the lynching of Willie Earle, which has been read before audiences at both the Upcountry History Museum and the Warehouse Theatre. When she\u2019s not writing or teaching about history, Hoffman, together with her husband Jeff, owns Aprons, Etc., where she worked in sales for 18 years.

Maybe, but maybe not. It is not that we have lost the art of communication, but that communication has become complicated with every new technology going back to the invention of the written alphabet. It's always claimed that something has been lost, but the pattern of that concept, then also opens the door to look at new possibilities and forms of communication.\r\n\u00a0\r\nAbout Travers Scott\r\nDr. Scott holds a PhD in Communication from the Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism at the University of Southern California.
