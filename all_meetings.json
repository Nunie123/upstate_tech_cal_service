Game theory provides a powerful framework for modeling and optimizing a wide range of real-world systems including networks, auctions, matchings, markets, ecosystems, and more.

He has held several CEO positions in Ranger\u2019s ventures, notably of Keystone Helicopter, ASIG, and most currently Ranger International Services Group, Inc. Townes and the Ranger team grew Keystone Helicopter from under $50MM to over $125MM in 4 years, creating superior returns for institutional investors. He and the Ranger team roughly doubled ASIG in less than 4 years, and vaulted it to \u201cbest in world\u201d quality rankings. In 2007, Ranger Rotorcraft Group was formed as another new platform company for additional segment consolidation efforts, in partnership with private equity institutional investors. In December 2008, Ranger International Services Group was capitalized with private and institutional funds to create a consolidation in government-outsourced Airfield Services & Logistics, with Townes as CEO. Ranger International made its first acquisition in January 2009, and is pursuing organic growth plus additional acquisitions in that sector.\r\n\r\nTownes is an engineering graduate of West Point. Steve earned the coveted Eisenhower Award upon graduation there. He also holds an MBA from Long Island University and completed the PMD program at Harvard Business School. He is a featured speaker at aerospace conventions and symposia and has testified on aviation matters before the U.S. House of Representatives, FAA and NTSB.\r\n\r\nUnder his leadership for over 10 years, Ranger\u2019s previous subsidiary revenues and profits rose steadily. In April 1999, ASIG was voted \"Best in World\" in an independent survey of major airlines, and Ranger was cited as an innovative new parent company. Keystone Helicopter won numerous FAA \u201cDiamond Awards\u201d for quality. Enterprise Value in Ranger\u2019s most recently sold venture more than quadrupled under Townes\u2019 leadership. Efforts are intended to follow the same success patterns with Ranger\u2019s newest enterprises.\r\n\r\nTownes\u2019 diverse background spans three decades in the commercial, corporate, and military aviation industry. Before going independent with Ranger Aerospace in 1997, he was previously Vice Chairman, and earlier President, of Sabreliner Corporation's heavy aircraft services divisions. Under Townes, that business was doubled in size, underwent a successful turnaround, struggled through an emergency crisis following a tragic crash, revamped its training and quality programs, and won new backlogs worth more than $500 million in multi-year revenues.\r\n\r\nTownes, known as a turnaround specialist, general manager, marketing expert, change agent and dealmaker in the industry, gained positive recognition by the trade press as an industry leader from Congressional, FAA and NTSB appearances in past years, calling for industry safety reforms, better auditing, and cargo hold smoke detectors. He was President and Partner of an avionics components house that doubled in size under Townes' marketing leadership. Townes was Executive Vice President of Stevens Aviation, a $115 million multi-city aviation services chain which more than doubled in size and made two acquisitions while Townes was its chief operations, marketing and technical services officer.\r\n\r\nTownes has also been Vice President of Major Programs and Marketing of the Dee Howard Aerospace Corporation, as well as a Program Leader and Marketing Leader in LTV Aerospace and Defense. His diverse and distinguished aerospace career has made him an ideal partner with private equity groups, venture capitalists, and other co-investors in Ranger Aerospace acquisitions.\r\n\r\nHis CEO level skills are also well suited to the consulting, Board level coaching, capital raising, and deal-making efforts of Ranger Partners Group on behalf of its client companies. For example, Townes is on the Board of a middle market sized aerospace and avionics components company in Atlanta that has grown from under $15MM to over $50MM in less than 4 years, and Steve acts as an effective Board coach for the young entrepreneurs who run that fast growing enterprise.\r\n\r\n\r\n", "uuid": "d0baef4f-4771-40b5-8e08-8a8e30095d85", "nid": "19", "data_as_of": "2018-04-20T02:23:05Z"}, {"event_name": "Learning Lunch: InnoMobility and Beyond - A Platform to Grow and Connect Future Technologies", "group_name": "GSATC", "venue": {"name": null, "address": "670 Verdae Blvd, None", "city": "Greenville", "state": null, "zip": "29607", "country": "US", "lat": "34.8263361", "lon": "-82.3259364"}, "url": "https://www.eventbrite.com/e/learning-lunch-innomobility-and-beyond-a-platform-to-grow-and-connect-future-technologies-tickets-1725522083", "time": "2011-06-08T15:30:00Z", "tags": "", "rsvp_count": null, "created_at": "2011-05-23T15:56:57Z", "description": "We just had a great GSATC lunch where Steve Townes explained to us how Ranger Aerospace has achieved phenomenal growth in aerospace.

work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\nOur main presentation; \"Designing a Dimensional Model.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\u00a0Business Intelligence (BI)\u00a0 is one of the fastest growing segments in information technology today.\u00a0 In large part due to demands placed on business to innovate fast and get information to the right people at the right time.\u00a0 Also fueling the trend is the sudden proliferation of BI and analytical tools at a price-point that even small and medium sized companies can afford.\u00a0 At the heart of an efficient , responsive and flexible BI solution is a dimensional model.\u00a0\u00a0 Even if you just need to make your reporting system more efficient and do not have lofty goals of Business Scorecarding with Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) or creating forecasting models with data mining algorithms, knowing how and when to create a dimensional model is a must have skill in the 21st century.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\nThis will be a manager and business analyst friendly presentation so invite one to come along. \r\n\r\n", "uuid": "751199d1-3e18-4351-8c06-6f965fab3740", "nid": "30", "data_as_of": "2018-04-20T02:23:05Z"},

Microsoft SQL Server 2005 Report Builder: Microsoft SQL Server 2005 Report Builder is a useful but often over-looked tool in the SQL Server 2005 platform.\u00a0 A new addition with 2005 Reporting Services, Report Builder enables end-users to create and publish their own ad-hoc reports without the need to know SQL or understand the backend data model.\u00a0 As a .NET Winforms \u201cClickonce\u201d application, Report Builder can easily be deployed to your users with a simple click from within Reporting Services.\u00a0 However, it\u2019s not all paradise.\u00a0 There are some interesting quirks and limitations to this 1.0 product that can challenge even the best SQL Server guru.\u00a0 We\u2019ll discuss the history, uses, best practices, and tips to the latest addition to the Microsoft SQL Server family.\r\n\u00a0\r\nAbout Jason:\u00a0 Jason is currently a Business Intelligence Architect at Ameco, a subsidiary of Fluor.\u00a0 He has been working in IT for over 11 years developing both internal and external web, e-commerce, and data warehouse applications.\u00a0 He\u2019s a \u201csql ninja\u201d that has been hacking out T-SQL since SQL Server 6.0.\u00a0 He has presented at the SC Code Camp and the SQL Server Innovators Guild. \r\n\r\n", "uuid": "751199d1-3e18-4351-8c06-6f965fab3740", "nid": "30", "data_as_of": "2018-04-20T02:23:05Z"},

However, for simple, straightforward data transfer tasks, creating SSIS packages by hand can be time-consuming and repetitious. By attending this session, you'll learn how to automate data transfers from a source to a target using SSIS. You\u2019ll see the steps necessary to create both the control flow and the data flow portions of an SSIS package using the API and C# code. You\u2019ll also learn about altering existing packages programmatically. Specific attention will be given to the generation of data flows with the proper source and destination components. We\u2019ll take a look at some of the open source solutions available for this, plus some \u201croll your own\u201d options.\r\n\u00a0\r\nTakeaways:1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Generating Control Flow Tasks through the API2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Generating Data Flow Components through the API3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 How to Alter Existing Packages Programmatically\r\n\u00a0\r\nJohn Welch is Chief Architect with Mariner, a consulting firm specializing in enterprise reporting & analytics, data warehousing and performance management solutions.

A barrier to realizing that potential is that we don\u2019t always understand or trust the techniques that reveal these insights.\r\n\r\nThe payoffs from data analysis can be tremendous, but to realize them we have to know how to match the analytical techniques with our business questions/purposes, and with the data. The session will illustrate this simple idea with three examples of techniques borrowed from artificial intelligence: Genetic Algorithms for optimization, Artificial Neural Networks for prediction, and the ID3 algorithm for classification. Specific attention will be paid to:\r\n\r\n\r\nHow they work\r\nWhat you can do with them\r\nWhen to use them with or instead of statistical techniques\r\nHow to evaluate the results\r\n\r\n\r\nThese techniques are valuable because they are heuristic rather than statistical, are easily understood without advanced mathematics, are often simpler to use, and will deliver better answers than standard methods in a variety of situations.\r\n\u00a0\r\nAbout Jim Eynon\r\n\u00a0\r\nJim's first job from college was with a data service company where he hung a very large but uncounted number of round-reel tapes. He subsequently mastered other obsolete technologies such as writing COBOL and Mark IV. Eventually this all drove him to graduate school for a PhD in the Management of Information. \u00a0He has served on the faculty at Wake Forest and Northern Illinois Universities, teaching Systems Analysis and Design, Database Systems, Management Science and Information Systems Strategy. His research is published in information systems journals and conference proceedings. He consulting work includes problems in Manufacturing, banking and financial services, health care, government agencies, transportation, education, and \u00a0retail. \u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\nSponsor\r\n\r\nVarigence provides tools, frameworks, and services that advance the state of the art in business intelligence by building abstraction and productivity capabilities to extend the Microsoft Business Intelligence technologies.\r\n\u00a0\r\n", "uuid": "751199d1-3e18-4351-8c06-6f965fab3740", "nid": "30", "data_as_of": "2018-04-20T02:23:05Z"}, {"event_name": "Agile Database Administration", "group_name": "SQL Server Innovators Guild", "venue": {"name": "ECPI, Greenville, SC", "address": "1001 Keys Dr, None", "city": "Greenville", "state": null, "zip": "29615", "country": "US", "lat": "34.84496", "lon": "-82.313811"}, "url": "https://www.eventbrite.com/e/agile-database-administration-tickets-3052194195", "time": "2012-03-06T23:00:00Z", "tags": "", "rsvp_count": null, "created_at": "2012-02-29T02:59:44Z", "description": "\u00a0\r\n6:00 \u2013 6:30 Food and Networking Sponsored by FGP\r\n6:30 \u2013 6:45 Announcements\r\n6:45 \u2013 8:15\u00a0Stuart R Ainsworth:\u00a0Agile Database Administration\r\n8:15 \u2013 8:30 Closing remarks and give-a-ways. \u00a0\r\nAgile Database Administration\u00a0\r\nAgile development is all the rage, but how do the principles apply to database administrators? \u00a0This presentation will introduce the basics of the Agile Manifesto, and explain how they can be applied to non-development IT work, such as database administration, maintenance, and support. \u00a0We'll cover scrum (one of the most popular development methodologies) and kanban, and identify some of the common struggles with implementing them in an organization. \u00a0This is an interactive discussion; please bring your tales of success and your horror stories.\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\nStuart R.

After school he did what all engineers do: moved to Manhattan to become an options and securities principal at Duke & Company (and later Morgan Stanley).

DRUM4WORK has expanded beyond the primitive dreams of a percussionist willing to to share and express his feelings through percussion into a thriving group of like-minded drummers and percussionists throughout the southeastern United States.\r\n\r\nTEDx Greenville Salons sponsored by Bon Secours St. Francis Health System\r\nCurated by the Salon Squad Volunteers\r\n\u00a0", "uuid": "7034cfee-a3bc-4456-b008-8c4db071d149", "nid": "45", "data_as_of": "2018-04-20T02:23:05Z"}, {"event_name": "TEDxGreenville July 2013 Salon - Independence", "group_name": "TEDx Greenville", "venue": {"name": "St. Francis Hospital (downtown) Bernadine Center, Room 302", "address": "1 Saint Francis Drive, None", "city": "Greenville", "state": null, "zip": "29601", "country": "US", "lat": "34.840334", "lon": "-82.42170199999998"}, "url": "https://www.eventbrite.com/e/tedxgreenville-july-2013-salon-independence-tickets-7532432709", "time": "2013-07-23T22:00:00Z", "tags": "", "rsvp_count": null, "created_at": "2013-07-19T12:35:31Z", "description": "TEDxGreenville July SalonIndependence\u00a0What does independence mean?

It\u2019s short\u2026 unexpected and memorable\u2026 and has broad, diverse meanings which makes it relevant to countless topics. It might imply opening up to new ideas or experiences\u2026 letting go of your masks or limiting emotions\u2026 revealing an epiphany that was previously hidden\u2026 shedding stereotypes and fears which confine\u2026 or peeling back layers so the heart of a problem emerges.When we\u2019re \u201cunzipped,\u201d intrinsic creative qualities such as wonder, enchantment, exploration, play, and delight emerge naturally. We readily pursue passions. And differences in attitudes, appearance, and lifestyle matter less\u2026 or not at all. Existing and thinking differently becomes natural and accepted.Our 2014 theme may seem like an odd choice to some, but, in the spirit of TED, it\u2019s a positive challenge to our comfort zones and levels of acceptance. It\u2019s certainly helped shape a memorable program!\"\r\n\r\nJoin us on April 11 as we continue the tradition of creating ideas worth spreading.\u00a0\r\nJust complete the little survey on the payment form on the next page.\r\nNote: Tickets to TEDxGreenville are non-refundable.\r\n\u00a0\r\nQuestions?\u00a0 Learn more about TEDxGreenville at www.TEDxGreenville.com.

Since her college career as a history major, she has always been drawn to stories, different viewpoints, and challenging ideas. It was during her time in Clemson that she first became aware of improvisational comedy, which now plays a tremendous role in her life.\r\n\r\nIn 2012, Meg co-founded Alchemy Comedy Theater in Greenville, which has expanded from four improvisors to more than sixty people in the company. One of her primary passions is education and she teaches improv courses in Alchemy\u2019s training center as well as regional corporate workshops. In addition to the improvisation, she currently works as an actor, production assistant, and comedic writer for Cone of Shame, an informative video series on YouTube featuring great comedy and even better pet health advice. In addition to the videos, Meg travels internationally teaching improv workshops at veterinary conferences. This is her first time working with TEDx Greenville and she is thrilled to be a part of Kaleidoscope.\r\n\u00a0\r\nTEDxGreenvilleSalons are sponsored by Clemson MBA.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\n", "uuid": "7034cfee-a3bc-4456-b008-8c4db071d149", "nid": "45", "data_as_of": "2018-04-20T02:23:05Z"}, {"event_name": "TEDxGreenville 2016: Kaleidoscope", "group_name": "TEDx Greenville", "venue": {"name": "Kroc Center", "address": "424 Westfield Street, None", "city": "Greenville", "state": null, "zip": "29601", "country": "US", "lat": "34.847942", "lon": "-82.40932299999997"}, "url": "https://www.eventbrite.com/e/tedxgreenville-2016-kaleidoscope-tickets-22495090421", "time": "2016-04-08T13:00:00Z", "tags": "", "rsvp_count": null, "created_at": "2016-03-02T14:40:38Z", "description": "\r\nTickets on Sale Now!\u00a0\r\nYou know this event sells out every year.
