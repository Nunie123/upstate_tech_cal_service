## Greenville Tech Calendar Service

This application will expose a REST API that will return a JSON of upcoming tech meetups in the Greenville-Spartanburg area.

This API will use the API provided by Code for Greenville [here](https://github.com/codeforgreenville/OpenData/issues/17) to get the list of organizations to be included in the calendar.  It will then make requests to the APIs of the various applications where the meeting data is being hosted (meetup.com, facebook, eventbright, etc.).
