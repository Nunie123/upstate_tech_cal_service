## Greenville Tech Meetup Events / Calendar API Service

This application provides an endpoint to return event data for all [meetup groups](https://data.openupstate.org/organizations) listed in the [meetups API](https://github.com/codeforgreenville/OpenData/issues/17) if they host their meetings on [meetup.com](https://github.com/codeforgreenville/upstate_tech_cal_service/issues/2)
or [eventbrite.com](https://github.com/codeforgreenville/upstate_tech_cal_service/issues/4).

Meeting services currently not supported: [Facebook](https://github.com/codeforgreenville/upstate_tech_cal_service/issues/5), [Nvite](https://github.com/codeforgreenville/upstate_tech_cal_service/issues/6), [Open Collective](https://github.com/codeforgreenville/upstate_tech_cal_service/issues/2), and [custom websites](https://github.com/codeforgreenville/upstate_tech_cal_service/issues/7).

To be added or provided updates to this list, make a comment on [one of the issues](https://github.com/codeforgreenville/upstate_tech_cal_service/issues).

The exposed JSON includes past and future meetings, but defaults to providing only future meetings unless a `start_date` is specified. The data comes from the associated event hosting website APIs and is updated every five minutes.

You can access this data by going here: https://events.openupstate.org/api/gtc

### Documentation

#### Setup
If you're new here, then initial setup of test or production environment with Python + Miniconda + Flask app can be found in the [deploy_notes_initial.md](https://github.com/codeforgreenville/upstate_tech_cal_service/blob/master/deploy_notes_initial.md)

Other [general application notes are included in the issue from before the app was migrated](https://github.com/codeforgreenville/upstate_tech_cal_service/issues/14) off Heroku onto a dedicated server.

#### Interacting with a Running Application

You may filter by any tags applied to the organization on the openupstate.org api.  Currently the openupstate.org api only provides Tag IDs (i.e. an integer) instead of descriptive tags. (e.g. https://events.openupstate.org/api/gtc?tags=1)

You may also filter the return result by providing a `start_date` and `end_date` like so: https://events.openupstate.org/api/gtc?start_date=2018-01-01&end_date=2018-02-01 (the application currently assumes "US/Eastern" as the timezone when a date filter is provided)

The format of the JSON that returns is:
